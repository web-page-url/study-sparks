# Study Sparks Environment Variables Setup

Create a file named `.env.local` in your project root directory with the following content:

```
# Study Sparks Environment Variables
# Get your Gemini API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

# Required for AI Chatbot
NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_api_key_here

# Optional: For existing AI comparison feature
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
```

## Important Notes:
- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is required for client-side access in Next.js
- Replace `your_actual_gemini_api_key_here` with your real Gemini API key
- Restart your development server after creating this file
- Never commit `.env.local` to version control (it's already in .gitignore)

## Testing:
1. After setup, restart: `npm run dev`
2. Visit: http://localhost:3000
3. Click the chat bubble (bottom-right)
4. Chatbot should now respond with AI-powered answers!
